## SQL Constraints

SQL constraints are rules enforced on data columns in a database table to ensure the integrity, accuracy, and reliability of the data. Constraints are used to prevent invalid data from being inserted into the database.

Types of SQL Constraints :

NOT NULL <br>
UNIQUE <br>
PRIMARY KEY <br>
FOREIGN KEY <br>
CHECK <br>
DEFAULT <br>
AUTO_INCREMENT<BR>

**1. NOT NULL -**

The NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value. It forces the field to always contain a value.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100)
);
```
Here, FirstName and LastName cannot be null.
<hr/>

**2. UNIQUE -**

The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all the values in a column are different. This is similar to PRIMARY KEY, but a table can have multiple UNIQUE constraints, while it can only have one PRIMARY KEY.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```
In this example, the Email field must have unique values for each employee.
<hr/>

**3. PRIMARY KEY -**

The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. A table can only have one primary key, which can be a single column or a combination of multiple columns (composite key).

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50)
);
```
The EmployeeID is a unique identifier for each employee.
<hr/>

**4. FOREIGN KEY -**

The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to link two tables. It is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)
);
```
Here, DepartmentID in the Employees table is a foreign key referencing DepartmentID in the Departments table.
<hr/>

**5. CHECK -**

The CHECK constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    CHECK (Age >= 18),
    CHECK (Salary > 0)
);
```
This example ensures that the Age is at least 18 and the Salary is greater than 0.
<hr/>

**6. DEFAULT -**

The DEFAULT constraint provides a default value for a column when no value is specified during the insert operation.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    StartDate DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);
```
Here, StartDate will default to the current date if no date is provided.

**7. AUTO_INCREMENT -**

- The AUTO_INCREMENT constraint is usually applied to an integer column.<br>
- It automatically assigns a unique value to the column whenever a new row is inserted.<br>
- The starting value for AUTO_INCREMENT is usually 1 and increments by 1 for each new record. However, this can be configured to start at a different value or increment by a different number.<br>
- Only one AUTO_INCREMENT column is allowed per table, and it must be indexed (usually, this is the primary key).<br>

Example:

Letâ€™s create a table called Employees where the EmployeeID column uses the AUTO_INCREMENT constraint.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID)
);
```
In this example:

o The EmployeeID column is of type INT and has the AUTO_INCREMENT constraint.
o The PRIMARY KEY constraint is applied to the EmployeeID column, ensuring that it will uniquely identify each row.

*Inserting Data :*

You do not need to specify a value for the EmployeeID column when inserting data. The AUTO_INCREMENT constraint will automatically assign a unique value.

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName, DepartmentID)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 1),
       ('Jane', 'Smith', 2),
       ('Jim', 'Beam', 3);
```

Result:

The EmployeeID column will automatically get the values 1, 2, and 3 for the three inserted records.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

Result:

|EmployeeID|FirstName|	LastName |DepartmentID|
|----------|---------|-----------|------------|
|1         |	 John|	Doe	     |1           |
|2         |	 Jane|	Smith    |	2         |
|3         |	 Jim |Beam	     |3           |

In this example:

EmployeeID = 1 was assigned to John Doe.
EmployeeID = 2 was assigned to Jane Smith.
EmployeeID = 3 was assigned to Jim Beam.

### Using Constraints in Table Creation :

When creating a table, constraints are defined at the column level or table level:

- Column-Level Constraints:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (Salary > 0)
);
```

- Table-Level Constraints:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID),
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID),
    UNIQUE (Email),
    CHECK (Salary > 0)
);
```

SQL constraints are essential for maintaining the integrity of the data in a database. By using constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK and DEFAULT you can ensure that the data stored in your database is valid, unique, and consistent.
