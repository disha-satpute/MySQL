# MySQL Procedure

A stored procedure in MySQL is a set of SQL statements that are stored and executed on the database server. Stored procedures help improve performance by reducing the number of calls between the client and the server. They can include control structures, parameters, and can be used to encapsulate complex business logic.

## Simple Stored Procedure 

This example creates a stored procedure that takes a department ID as input and returns all employees in that department.

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDept(IN dept_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT EmpID, Name, Salary
    FROM Employees
    WHERE DepartmentID = dept_id;
END $$

DELIMITER ;
```
Explanation:

- DELIMITER $$ allows the use of $$ as a delimiter to define the procedure block since semicolons are used within the procedure.

- The procedure GetEmployeesByDept takes dept_id as an input parameter.

- It selects all employees from the Employees table where the department ID matches the given input.

### To call this procedure:

```sql
CALL GetEmployeesByDept(3);
```
