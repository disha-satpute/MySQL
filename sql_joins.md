## SQL Joins
SQL Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.<br> There are several types of joins that allow you to retrieve data from multiple tables, depending on the relationship between the tables and the desired result set.

Types of SQL Joins :

INNER JOIN
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN
FULL (OUTER) JOIN
CROSS JOIN
SELF JOIN


Letâ€™s explore each of these joins in detail with examples.

1. INNER JOIN
The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables. It returns only the rows where there is a match on the join condition.

Syntax:
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

Example:

Suppose we have two tables:

Employees:

EmployeeID	FirstName	LastName	DepartmentID
1	           John       Doe	        1
2	           Jane	      Smith	        2
3	           Jim	      Beam	        3

```sql
+-------------+----------------+----------+----------------+
| EmployeeID  |  FirstName    | LastName  |	DepartmentID   |
+-------------+-----------------+---------------------------+
|      1      |   John	      |   Doe	  |       1        |
|      2      |   Jane	      |  Smith	  |       2        |
|      3      |    Jim        |   Beam	  |       3        |
+-------------+---------------+-----------+----------------+
```

Departments:

```sql
+----------------+----------------+
|   DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
+----------------+----------------+
|  1	         |     HR	      |
|  2	         |  Finance       |
|  3             |     IT         |
+---------------------------------+
```

Result:

Query to get employee names along with their department names:

```sql
SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Departments
ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
```

Result:
```sql
+----------- -+----------+------------------+
|   FirstName | LastName  |	DepartmentName  |
+---------+----------+----------------------+
|   John	  |   Doe	  |       HR        |
|   Jane	  |  Smith	  |     Finance     |
|   Jim       |   Beam	  |       IT        |
+-------------------------------------------+
```

Explanation :
 The INNER JOIN returns only the rows where there is a match between Employees.DepartmentID and Departments.DepartmentID.
